//! The criome acceptance gate (Spirit `xhwa`, corrected 2026-07-07 to the
//! everywhere-gate) — LIVE.
//!
//! **The quorum gates acceptance everywhere, including locally.** With the
//! gate `Enabled`, a head-advancing working operation is STAGED — its
//! would-be log entries are built and durably parked WITHOUT committing —
//! and this gate asks the local criome to authorize the PROSPECTIVE head
//! digest `D` the staged group would produce. Only the pushed cluster grant
//! materializes the group and releases the held accepted reply; every other
//! terminal verdict refuses the operation to the caller and the staged group
//! is discarded — the head does not advance, not even locally, and nothing
//! propagates because nothing exists. The grant is the acceptance event.
//!
//! The authorizer is the CLUSTER authorizer: spirit submits one typed
//! question over its local criome working socket ("authorize this head
//! digest", carried as the typed [`AuthorizedObjectReference`] — no contract
//! / operation / scope strings) and consumes criome's authorization
//! observation session — the submission snapshot plus pushed updates until a
//! terminal state. Criome owns everything behind that socket: quorum
//! membership, the two-round commit, windows, and the BLS material. Spirit
//! never verifies BLS locally — the socket is the trust boundary, and the
//! full cryptographic re-judgment happens where the authorization crosses a
//! real boundary (the receiving node's criome). Spirit's own checks are the
//! closed binding matrix in [`HeadSessionBinding::decide`]: slot binding,
//! digest binding, grant presence and grant binding. Every violation is a
//! [`CriomeGateError`] and every fault refuses the operation — there is no
//! default-open branch anywhere in this parse.
//!
//! Whether the seam runs at all is the gate's [`CriomeAuthorization`] policy:
//! `Disabled` (the operative default) keeps the whole seam dormant — spirit
//! fully local, heads advance freely, nothing propagates; `Enabled` carries
//! the [`ClusterAuthorizer`] (the criome socket) and demands the cluster
//! grant BEFORE any head-advancing operation is accepted. An enabled gate
//! whose criome is unreachable refuses every advance — fail-closed. Reads
//! are unaffected. The ship drain reuses the same authorizer at ship time,
//! where the ask short-circuits to criome's immediate re-grant of the
//! standing committed head (distribution, never a second acceptance
//! judgment).
