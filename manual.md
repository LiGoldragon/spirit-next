# Spirit manual

This is the current Spirit 0.27.0 object guide. The ordinary schema at
`signal-spirit@b37fc963292c157452d06e150296c19005dae3f2` and the owner schema
at `meta-signal-spirit@009cb6c8ddf985244189a79d554aa5d5c24605c8` are the
authoritative command and type definitions.

## Invocation and replies

Invoke `spirit` with exactly one ordinary Query object and `spirit-meta` with
exactly one owner Query object. The environment variables `SPIRIT_SOCKET` and
`SPIRIT_META_SOCKET` choose their respective Unix sockets. A bare atom is a
complete object. Flags, path operands, zero operands, and multiple operands are
rejected; neither help flags nor temporary `.nota` files are part of this
language.

```sh
SPIRIT_SOCKET=/run/user/1000/spirit.sock spirit Version
SPIRIT_META_SOCKET=/run/user/1000/meta-spirit.sock spirit-meta ObserveHead
```

Successful requests print one typed Datom reply. Rejection is likewise typed:
ordinary requests can return `GuardianRejected`, `Rejected`, `AdvanceRefused`,
or `Error`; owner configuration can return `Rejected`. Transport/decode errors
go to stderr and return nonzero. Do not place provider prompts, provider
responses, deployed record bodies, secrets, or session material in transcripts.

## Ordinary objects

All record-writing shapes use this four-field entry and request justification:

```text
Entry         = ([(Technology (Software (Data SchemaEvolution)))] Constraint [description] Medium)
Justification = ([([evidence] None)] [reasoning])
Query         = (Any Any Any None Any)
```

The ordinary Input roots are exactly the following 21 roots. These are
canonical object forms (replace illustrative identifiers and text with typed
values suitable for the request):

```text
State                 (State [statement])
Record                (Record (([domains] Constraint [description] Medium) ([([evidence] None)] [reasoning])))
Propose               (Propose (([domains] Principle [description] Medium) ([([evidence] None)] [reasoning])))
Clarify               (Clarify (record-id [clarifying description] ([([evidence] None)] [reasoning])))
Supersede             (Supersede ([record-id] [([domains] Decision [replacement] Medium)] ([([evidence] None)] [reasoning])))
Retire                (Retire (record-id ([([evidence] None)] [reasoning])))
ResolveClarification  (ResolveClarification (clarification-id [(record-id [replacement])] ([([evidence] None)] [reasoning])))
Observe               (Observe (Any Any Any None Any))
TextSearch            (TextSearch [description words])
Lookup                (Lookup record-id)
Count                 (Count (Any Any Any None Any))
BumpImportance        (BumpImportance record-id)
ChangeRecord          (ChangeRecord (record-id ([domains] Constraint [replacement] High) ([([evidence] None)] [reasoning])))
LookupStash           (LookupStash 1)
Tap                   (Tap All)
Untap                 (Untap 1)
ApplyAuthorizedRecord (ApplyAuthorizedRecord (record-id [versioned-entry-hex] [authorization-evidence-hex]))
SubscribeIntent       (SubscribeIntent (Any Any Any None Any))
Version               Version
Marker                Marker
Intent                (Intent [All])
```

`Observe` and `Count` use the five-predicate `Query` in this order:
`DomainMatch`, `KeywordMatch`, `TextMatch`, `SelectedKind`, and
`ImportanceSelection`. Domain matches are `Any`, `(Partial [scopes])`, or
`(Full [scopes])`; keyword matches are `Any`, `(AnyKeyword [keywords])`, or
`(AllKeywords [keywords])`; text matches are `Any` or `(ContainsText [text])`;
kind is `None` or `(Some Kind)`; importance is `Any`, `(ExactImportance
Magnitude)`, `(AtMostImportance Magnitude)`, or `(AtLeastImportance
Magnitude)`.

`TextSearch` is the compact ranked description lookup. `Lookup` resolves one
identifier. `LookupStash` reopens a result set returned by `Observe`.
`SubscribeIntent` emits `Event` replies after the initial subscription reply.
`Tap` and `Untap` manage operation observation. `ApplyAuthorizedRecord` is the
typed cluster-authorized write path; ordinary callers should not fabricate its
evidence.

## Owner objects

The owner-only meta socket has exactly four roots:

```text
Configure         (Configure (Default None None None))
Import            (Import [(record-id ([domains] Constraint [description] Medium))])
ObserveHead       ObserveHead
ObserveHeadObject ObserveHeadObject
```

`Configure` positions are archive target, optional mirror target, optional
Criome gate target, and optional guardian prompt target. `Import` contains
identifier-plus-four-field-entry values. `ObserveHead` reports marker and
optional digest; `ObserveHeadObject` reports marker and optional serialized
head object. These owner controls are not ordinary capture operations.

## Data, lifecycle, and operations safety

An active record is only `Entry { Domains Kind Description Importance }`.
`RecordRequest` and `Proposal` add a justification at the operation boundary.
There are no active certainty, core privacy, referent registration, relation,
public/private class, default/private shorthand, `PublicTextSearch`,
`ChangeCertainty`, `ChangePrivacy`, or `CollectRemovalCandidates` operations.

`ChangeRecord` retains an identifier while replacing its four-field entry.
`Retire`, `Supersede`, and `ResolveClarification` name their targets and place
retained data in the lifecycle archive before retraction. Records and archive
contents are operationally confidential even though core Spirit has no privacy
field: keep owner sockets, store locations, credentials, session references,
provider material, raw corpus bodies, and diagnostics closed or redacted.

The zero-argument `spirit-nexus` daemon speaks binary Signal frames and reads persisted desired configuration from its stable Sema. `spirit-write-configuration` and `spirit-migrate-store` are offline maintenance tools, not public grammar examples for `spirit` or `spirit-meta`.
