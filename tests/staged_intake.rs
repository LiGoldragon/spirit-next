//! THE EVERYWHERE-GATE INTAKE WITNESSES (§3.5, §3.8, §3.9).
//!
//! With criome authorization Enabled, a head-advancing working operation is
//! STAGED — built and durably parked without committing — and accepted ONLY
//! on the cluster grant; every other terminal verdict refuses the operation
//! to the caller (`Response::AdvanceRefused`) and discards the staged group,
//! so nothing is recorded anywhere: the head does not advance, not even
//! locally. Reads are unaffected.
//!
//! Falsification lines: if spirit bypassed criome, the refused legs would
//! accept and advance the head; if staging leaked, a refused operation would
//! leave an observable trace (count, head, outbox, queries); if the grant
//! were not the acceptance event, the granted leg would differ from the
//! Disabled-mode twin byte-for-byte; if recovery discarded a granted group,
//! the crash leg's cluster-accepted digest would name entries nobody holds.
